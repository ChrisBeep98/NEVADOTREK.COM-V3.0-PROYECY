# Nevado Trek - Design Principles & Tone

## 1. The Voice: "The Experienced Guide"
We are not just a booking engine. We are the Sherpa.
*   **Tone:** Confident, Safe, Encouraging, Respectful of Nature.
*   **Keywords:** "Cumbre" (Summit), "Respeto" (Respect), "Desafío" (Challenge), "Inolvidable" (Unforgettable).

## 2. Design Principles

### A. Atmosphere over Information
Don't just say "It's cold". Make the UI *feel* cold using cool blues, white text, and frosted glass.
Don't just say "It's sunny". Use the Frailejón Gold glow.

### B. Motion simulates the Trek
*   **Scrolling Down = Climbing Up.**
    As the user scrolls down the page, the background might transition from the Green Valley (Cocora) to the Grey Rocks (Paramo) to the White Snow (Summit).
*   **Parallax:** Background mountains move slower than foreground palms. Gives depth.

### C. Clarity in Chaos
The mountains are rugged and chaotic. The UI must be the opposite: Clean, Grid-based, Organized. The user relies on us for structure.

## 3. Accessibility (Safety First)
Just like on the mountain, safety is paramount.
*   **Contrast:** Ensure the Amber text on Slate background passes WCAG AA.
*   **Readability:** No tiny text. Font size 16px minimum for body text.
*   **Touch Targets:** Big buttons for tired fingers (mobile first).
